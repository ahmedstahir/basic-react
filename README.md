## First React Project

The aim of this project was to
- understand how to bootstrap a project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- deploy the website on [Surge](https://surge.sh)
- use GitHub Actions to get a flavor of CI/CD

Repository created as part of [Bootcamp 2020](https://github.com/panacloud/bootcamp-2020) online sessions
